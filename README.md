# mcmc

Some python code to simulate Markov chain Monte Carlo. 
1) Hard-core model (e.g., binary coloring graph)
2) q-coloring graph with systematic sweep Gibbs sampling + Fisher Yates shuffle O(q)
3) Basic MC simulation.


Implementation of several clustring evaluation metrics:

Normalized cut + modularity for non-groundtruth dataset.
Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), Rand Index (Rand Index), Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) and Purity
